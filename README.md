# Rapidly-exploring-Random-Tree-RRT-Algorithm-for-Obstacle-Avoidance
Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) Algorithm for Obstacle Avoidance for mobile robot and understanding how it works in Simulation.
RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) is a path planning algorithm often used for obstacle avoidance in robotics and other autonomous systems. 
It works by incrementally building a tree-like structure from a starting point towards a target point, while simultaneously avoiding obstacles in the environment.
